# uncommentedHackerNews
> Browser extension that removes comments from Hacker News

## Install
- [**Chrome** extension][link-cws] [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/phebmndmhncehfjhckdgcikpeffkhcll.svg?label=%20">][link-cws]
- [**Firefox** add-on][link-amo] [<img valign="middle" src="https://img.shields.io/amo/v/uncommentedhn.svg?label=%20">][link-amo]

## Why
Lately I've found myself experiencing the problems described in [this article](https://speak.sh/posts/quiet-hacker-news), I automatically go into the comments section of all HN articles and only read that, drastically decreasing the Signal to Noise Ratio of the contents I read and thus lowering the value per unit of time I get out of reading Hacker News. In order to reverse that trend in my behaviour I made this.

## Development
```bash
bash build.sh # Build extension into a .zip bundle
bash build.sh -i # Build icons
```
